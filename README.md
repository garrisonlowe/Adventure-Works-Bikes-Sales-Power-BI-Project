# Adventure Works Analysis Dashboard

In this project, we are given some requirements from Steve over at Adventure Works to create a dashboard for his sales team to use.

Let's take a look at the email.

> Steven  - Sales Manager:
>
> Hi!
> I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
> Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.
> Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.
> We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. 
> The budget is for 2023 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
> Let me know if you need anything else!
>
> // Steven
